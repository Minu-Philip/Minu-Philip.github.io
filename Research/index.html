         <p style="font-size:90%"> Strokes are roughly twice more likely to be missed among Black patients, with most of the disparity arising from physicians testing Black patients less often.
           We develop a method to quantify the role of disparate treatment by physicians in driving this difference in testing.
           Specifically, we leverage a unique feature of strokes: whether a patient actually had a stroke can be inferred retrospectively even if initially misdiagnosed.
           This allows us to benchmark testing decisions against racially objective predictions of stroke risk made by a machine learning model trained on the true underlying stroke states.
           We decompose disparate treatment into two forces: an unjustified skill gap, where physicians make noisier risk assessments for Black patients; and racial prejudice, where physicians are less likely to test Black patients conditional on their risk assessment.
           Disparate treatment accounts for about 65% of the racial disparity in testing.
           Removing racial prejudice would lower testing disparities by half.
           <!--This paper studies racial disparity in stroke diagnosis at emergency departments. 
           The unique feature of this setting is that the underlying state of whether the patient actually had a stroke can be inferred retrospectively. 
           We find that strokes are roughly twice more likely to be missed among Black patients, with most of the disparity arising from physicians testing Black patients less often. 
           We then ask how much of this disparity comes from disparate treatment by physicians. 
           Disparate treatment by race within a facility is indicated by difference in testing rates conditional on the same disease risk. 
           Physicians, however, infer disease risk based on signals such as symptoms or patient history that potentially vary in quality or informativeness across racial groups. 
           To facilitate cross-group comparisons, we benchmark testing decisions against objective algorithmic predictions of disease risk. 
           We show that disparate treatment accounts for about 60% of this racial disparity in testing, realized via two mechanisms: <i>unjustified skill gap</i>, wherein physicians make noisier risk assessments for Black patients, and <i>racial prejudice</i> in the canonical sense, where physicians apply differential thresholds. 
           The two mechanisms are not only distinct conceptually but also have different implications for policy.-->

       <div class="content">
         <p style="font-size:90%"> Parents with a preferential bias for sons often influence the sex composition of their children by either continuing childbearing until a desired number of sons are born, or by selectively aborting female fetuses (sex selection).
           I propose and empirically validate a general heuristic that characterizes such parents’ son-targeting strategies in terms of when they decide to sex select. 
           I show that parents typically sex select at their stated ideal number of children, consistent with a heuristic of sex selecting in order to avoid exceeding this ideal number.
           This pattern is further validated by exploiting the natural independence between a child’s sex and the length of the preceding birth interval in the absence of sex selection: yet, among mothers at their ideal parity, a correlation emerges, consistent with the heuristic. 
           I also provide evidence of sex selection at the first birth order, as well as of reversals in parents’ decisions to sex select.

          <button type="button" class="collapsible"> » Abstract </button>
          <div class="content">
          <p style="font-size:90%"> Groups, including those created based on trivial and meaningless criteria, exhibit group-bias by favoring their in-group relative to the out-group. 
            What generates this bias has been a source of debate: Is it an effect of salience in categorization, or is what appears to be group-bias merely a consequence of strategic behavior to gain from the interdependence of payoffs in settings with groups? 
            Using groups induced in the lab, I experimentally manipulate payoff structures to study what drives this bias in interpersonal interactions. I find subjects to favor their assigned in-group even when their respective in-groups <i>cannot</i> affect their payoffs. 
            Categorization is hence a sufficient source of group-bias that operates even in the absence of any strategic pecuniary interests or expectations of generalized reciprocity. 
            Additionally, I find subjects to attach importance to group labels more than just as a salient dimension of categorization, and care about how they’re perceived by their in-group. 
            Subjects are asked to nominate two out of a total of four group members for a bonus, and the nomination results are revealed only to treated groups. 
            Subjects informed of being nominated by their in-group not only increase their allocations to the in-group but also decrease allocations to the out-group, thereby exhibiting more group-bias. This is consistent with subjects identifying with their assigned group and drawing non-pecuniary gains from the categorization. 
            Those informed of their non-nomination decrease allocations to all and do not maintain any positive distinctness between their in-group and out-group, as if having disidentified from the group labels.
