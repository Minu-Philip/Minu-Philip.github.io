     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Parents who prefer sons are known to engineer the sex-composition of their living children using prenatal sex-selective abortion and differential fertility stopping. 
          When parents optimize over when to stop childbearing and if or when to sex-select, simple heuristics emerge that broadly describe parents' composition-engineering strategies given their preferences and birth histories.
          This paper identifies such a heuristic whereby son-preferring parents in India sex-select when they are at their ideal number of children so as to avoid exceeding it. 
          Identification of fertility heuristics involve two components: (1) identifying instances of use of sex-selective methods, and (2) linking the use of sex-selective methods with parental preferences. 
          To identify use of prenatal sex-selective methods, I compare inter-birth intervals <i>preceding</i> the birth at any order, since intervals preceding male births would be artificially longer than those preceding female births if sex-selective methods were used. 
          To infer the heuristics, I check for the use of sex-selective methods at various birth-orders defined relative to the mother's ideal number of children. I find parents to typically sex-select when at the ideal number of children, even if means sex-selecting at the first birth order. 
          I also find evidence of reversals in the decision to sex-select following unsuccessful attempts at select birth histories.</p>

     <p style="font-size:90%; color:#505050"> <i> Abstract: </i> Son-preferring parents in India manipulate the sex-composition of their children either with differential stopping or pre-natal sex-selection. 
        This paper analyses retrospective birth histories of Indian women, to identify specific rules or heuristics that parents largely follow when resorting to sex-manipulating methods. 
        I use novel approaches such as analysing sex-ratios at <i> relative birth orders </i> defined with respect to parity, and exploiting the (non-) relation between the sex of a newborn and the length of the preceding birth-interval, to identify instances of pre-natal sex-selection. 
        I find that son-preferring parents typically engage in sex-selection only when they are at or about to exceed their desired parity. 
        There is significant heterogeneity in sex-manipulating behavior based on maternal education, owing to lower desired parity among the educated and a tendency to take-back their decision to sex-select after unsuccessful attempts. </p>

     <li> Groups and Interpersonal Behavior </li>
     <button type="button" class="collapsible"> » Abstract </button>
     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Synthetic groups, created based on trivial and meaningless criteria, exhibit groupness, i.e. they favor their <i>in-group</i> relative to the <i>out-group</i>.
          This paper investigates why even in the absence of social ties or history, groups matter in interpersonal interactions. 
          I examine the relevance of labeling in driving groupness (via <i>group identity</i>), against the alternative of being driven solely by strategic pecuniary interests (via <i>expectations of generalized reciprocity</i>).
          I experimentally manipulate payoff structures to show that subjects exhibit groupness even when their respective in-group <i>cannot</i> affect the subjects' payoff, maintaining that labeling is a significant source.
          To demonstrate if group labels hold any inherent significance for its members, I study subjects' reactions to how their synthetic in-group evaluates them. 
          I ask synthetic groups to nominate two out of a total of four members for a bonus, and reveal the nomination results only to treated subjects. 
          Subjects informed of being nominated exhibit more groupness by increasing their allocations to the in-group and decreasing allocations to the out-group. 
          Those informed of their non-nomination decrease allocations to all and do not maintain any positive distinctness between their in-group and out-group, as if having dis-identified.
          Individuals therefore do attach importance to group labels more than just a salient dimension of categorization, and do so even in the absence of any pecuniary gains.
