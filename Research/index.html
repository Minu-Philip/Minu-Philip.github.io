     <p>Son-preferring parents are known to manipulate the sex-composition of their children using differential fertility stopping or pre-natal sex-selection. 
          In this paper, we examine birth histories of Indian women to identify the heuristics that they largely use in deciding <i> when </i> to sex-select, if at all. 
          We exploit the non-relation between the sex of a newborn and the length of the preceding birth-interval to identify instances of pre-natal sex-selection that would artificially
          increase the interval preceding male births. We combine this with mothers' reported parity preferences to infer heuristics of parental manipulations. 
          Using a novel approach of redefining birth orders relative to the mother's ideal parity, we find that son-preferring parents typically engage in sex-selection when they 
          are at their ideal parity so as to avoid exceeding it. This is also true at the first birth order where some mothers with an ideal parity of one resort to sex-selection. 
          After select birth histories, we also find evidence of reversals in the decision to sex-select following unsuccessful attempts.</p>

     <p style="font-size:90%; color:#505050"> <i> Abstract: </i> Son-preferring parents in India manipulate the sex-composition of their children either with differential stopping or pre-natal sex-selection. 
        This paper analyses retrospective birth histories of Indian women, to identify specific rules or heuristics that parents largely follow when resorting to sex-manipulating methods. 
        I use novel approaches such as analysing sex-ratios at <i> relative birth orders </i> defined with respect to parity, and exploiting the (non-) relation between the sex of a newborn and the length of the preceding birth-interval, to identify instances of pre-natal sex-selection. 
        I find that son-preferring parents typically engage in sex-selection only when they are at or about to exceed their desired parity. 
        There is significant heterogeneity in sex-manipulating behavior based on maternal education, owing to lower desired parity among the educated and a tendency to take-back their decision to sex-select after unsuccessful attempts. </p>
