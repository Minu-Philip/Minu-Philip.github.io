     <p style="font-size:90%">  This paper studies racial disparity in stroke diagnosis at emergency departments. 
       The unique feature of this setting is that the underlying state of whether the patient actually had a stroke can be inferred retrospectively. 
       We find that strokes are roughly twice more likely to be missed among Black patients, with most of the disparity arising from physicians testing Black patients less often. 
       We then ask how much of this disparity comes from disparate treatment by physicians. 
       Disparate treatment by race within a facility is indicated by difference in testing rates conditional on the same disease risk. 
       Physicians, however, infer disease risk based on signals such as symptoms or patient history that potentially vary in quality or informativeness across racial groups. 
       To facilitate cross-group comparisons, we benchmark testing decisions against objective algorithmic risk projections. 
       We show that disparate treatment accounts for about 60% of this racial disparity in testing, realized via two mechanisms: <i>unjustified skill gap</i>, wherein physicians make noisier risk assessments for Black patients, and <i>racial prejudice</i> in the canonical sense, where physicians apply differential thresholds. 
       The two mechanisms are not only distinct conceptually but also have different implications for policy.</p>

   <li> Who is Sex-Selecting, and When?  </li> <span class ="subtext"> Co-Awarded Best Third Year Paper, NYU for AY 2020-2021</span>

     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Parents who prefer sons are known to engineer the sex-composition of their living children using prenatal sex-selective abortion and differential fertility stopping. 
          When parents optimize over when to stop childbearing and if or when to sex-select, simple heuristics emerge that broadly describe parents' composition-engineering strategies given their preferences and birth histories.
          This paper identifies such a heuristic whereby son-preferring parents in India sex-select when they are at their ideal number of children so as to avoid exceeding it. 
          Identification of fertility heuristics involve two components: (1) identifying instances of use of sex-selective methods, and (2) linking the use of sex-selective methods with parental preferences. 
          To identify use of prenatal sex-selective methods, I compare inter-birth intervals <i>preceding</i> the birth at any order, since intervals preceding male births would be artificially longer than those preceding female births if sex-selective methods were used. 
          To infer the heuristics, I check for the use of sex-selective methods at various birth-orders defined relative to the mother's ideal number of children. I find parents to typically sex-select when at the ideal number of children, even if means sex-selecting at the first birth order. 
          I also find evidence of reversals in the decision to sex-select following unsuccessful attempts at select birth histories.</p>

     <li> Group-Bias in Interpersonal Interactions </li>
     <button type="button" class="collapsible"> » Abstract </button>
     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Groups, including those created based on trivial and meaningless criteria, exhibit group-bias by favoring their in-group relative to the out-group. 
          What generates this bias has been a source of debate: Is it an effect of salience in categorization, or is what appears to be group-bias merely a consequence of strategic behavior to gain from the interdependence of payoffs in settings with groups? 
          Using groups induced in the lab, I experimentally manipulate payoff structures to study what drives this bias in interpersonal interactions. I find subjects to favor their assigned in-group even when their respective in-groups <i>cannot</i> affect their payoffs. 
          Categorization is hence a sufficient source of group-bias that operates even in the absence of any strategic pecuniary interests or expectations of generalized reciprocity. 
          Additionally, I find subjects to attach importance to group labels more than just as a salient dimension of categorization, and care about how they’re perceived by their in-group. 
          Subjects are asked to nominate two out of a total of four group members for a bonus, and the nomination results are revealed only to treated groups. 
          Subjects informed of being nominated by their in-group not only increase their allocations to the in-group but also decrease allocations to the out-group, thereby exhibiting more group-bias. This is consistent with subjects identifying with their assigned group and drawing non-pecuniary gains from the categorization. 
          Those informed of their non-nomination decrease allocations to all and do not maintain any positive distinctness between their in-group and out-group, as if having disidentified from the group labels. </p>
