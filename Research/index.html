         <p style="font-size:90%">  This paper studies racial disparity in stroke diagnosis at emergency departments. 
           The unique feature of this setting is that the underlying state of whether the patient actually had a stroke can be inferred retrospectively. 
           We find that strokes are roughly twice more likely to be missed among Black patients, with most of the disparity arising from physicians testing Black patients less often. 
           We then ask how much of this disparity comes from disparate treatment by physicians. 
           Disparate treatment by race within a facility is indicated by difference in testing rates conditional on the same disease risk. 
           Physicians, however, infer disease risk based on signals such as symptoms or patient history that potentially vary in quality or informativeness across racial groups. 
           To facilitate cross-group comparisons, we benchmark testing decisions against objective algorithmic predictions of disease risk. 
           We show that disparate treatment accounts for about 60% of this racial disparity in testing, realized via two mechanisms: <i>unjustified skill gap</i>, wherein physicians make noisier risk assessments for Black patients, and <i>racial prejudice</i> in the canonical sense, where physicians apply differential thresholds. 
           The two mechanisms are not only distinct conceptually but also have different implications for policy.

  <li style = margin-top:-18px;> <a> Who is Sex-Selecting, and When? </a>

       <div class="content">
         <p style="font-size:90%"> This paper studies fertility choices of parents in India who typically have a strong preferential bias for sons over daughters.
           Such parents are known to engineer the sex-composition of their children using prenatal sex-selective abortions or continued childbearing.
           I propose and empirically validate a general heuristic or a rule that describes <i> when </i> parents decide to sex-select.
           The decision to sex-select is motivated by a desire for more sons and necessitated by a high cost of continued childbearing.
           Identifying a heuristic of sex-selection therefore requires: (1) accounting for parental preferences over sex-composition and total children, and (2) observing parents' decisions of sex-selection.
           Towards the first, I use data on mothers' ideal number of children (self-reported) to define <i>relative birth orders</i> for all births in my sample indicating how far they are from their mother's ideal number of children. 
           The use of sex-selection at any relative birth order is indicated by skewed male-to-female births at the order.  
           I find the ratio of male-to-female births to be the highest for children born at their mother's ideal number of children. 
           This suggests a heuristic whereby parents sex-select when at their ideal number of children, to avoid exceeding it.
           I empirically validate this heuristic by exploiting the natural orthogonality between sex assigned at birth and the birth interval that precedes it.
           This orthogonality breaks down only if sex-selective abortion is resorted to, i.e. birth intervals preceding male births become artificially longer than those preceding female births.
           Following birth histories with no or few male births, I find intervals preceding male births to be longer for parents who are at their ideal parity than others—as the heuristic suggests.

          <button type="button" class="collapsible"> » Abstract </button>
          <div class="content">
          <p style="font-size:90%"> Groups, including those created based on trivial and meaningless criteria, exhibit group-bias by favoring their in-group relative to the out-group. 
            What generates this bias has been a source of debate: Is it an effect of salience in categorization, or is what appears to be group-bias merely a consequence of strategic behavior to gain from the interdependence of payoffs in settings with groups? 
            Using groups induced in the lab, I experimentally manipulate payoff structures to study what drives this bias in interpersonal interactions. I find subjects to favor their assigned in-group even when their respective in-groups <i>cannot</i> affect their payoffs. 
            Categorization is hence a sufficient source of group-bias that operates even in the absence of any strategic pecuniary interests or expectations of generalized reciprocity. 
            Additionally, I find subjects to attach importance to group labels more than just as a salient dimension of categorization, and care about how they’re perceived by their in-group. 
            Subjects are asked to nominate two out of a total of four group members for a bonus, and the nomination results are revealed only to treated groups. 
            Subjects informed of being nominated by their in-group not only increase their allocations to the in-group but also decrease allocations to the out-group, thereby exhibiting more group-bias. This is consistent with subjects identifying with their assigned group and drawing non-pecuniary gains from the categorization. 
            Those informed of their non-nomination decrease allocations to all and do not maintain any positive distinctness between their in-group and out-group, as if having disidentified from the group labels.
