     <p style="font-size:90%; color:#505050"> <i> Abstract: </i> Son-preferring parents in India manipulate the sex-composition of their children either with differential stopping or pre-natal sex-selection. 
        This paper analyses retrospective birth histories of Indian women, to identify specific rules or heuristics that parents largely follow when resorting to sex-manipulating methods. 
        I use novel approaches such as analysing sex-ratios at <i> relative birth orders </i> defined with respect to parity, and exploiting the (non-) relation between the sex of a newborn and the length of the preceding birth-interval, to identify instances of pre-natal sex-selection. 
        I find that son-preferring parents typically engage in sex-selection only when they are at or about to exceed their desired parity. 
        There is significant heterogeneity in sex-manipulating behavior based on maternal education, owing to lower desired parity among the educated and a tendency to take-back their decision to sex-select after unsuccessful attempts. </p>
