     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Parents with a preference for sons are known to manipulate the sex-composition of their children using prenatal sex-selective abortion or continued childbearing until their desired number of sons are born. 
          It is unlikely that parents consciously optimize a dynamic stochastic fertility problem when deciding whether and when to use such methods, but rather rely on simple heuristics. 
          This paper identifies one such heuristic whereby son-preferring parents sex-select when they are at their ideal number of children so as to avoid exceeding it. 
          Identification of the heuristic involves two components: (1) identifying instances of use of sex-selective methods, and (2) linking the use of such methods with fertility choices and parental preferences.
          To identify use of prenatal sex-selective abortion, I compare inter-birth intervals preceding male births, that would be artificially longer than those preceding female births if sex-selective methods were used.
          I then infer heuristics based on the use of such methods at various birth-orders defined relative to the mother's ideal number of children.
          In addition to the tendency to sex-select when at the ideal number of children, I also find evidence of reversals in the decision to sex-select following unsuccessful attempts at select birth histories.</p>

     <p style="font-size:90%; color:#505050"> <i> Abstract: </i> Son-preferring parents in India manipulate the sex-composition of their children either with differential stopping or pre-natal sex-selection. 
        This paper analyses retrospective birth histories of Indian women, to identify specific rules or heuristics that parents largely follow when resorting to sex-manipulating methods. 
        I use novel approaches such as analysing sex-ratios at <i> relative birth orders </i> defined with respect to parity, and exploiting the (non-) relation between the sex of a newborn and the length of the preceding birth-interval, to identify instances of pre-natal sex-selection. 
        I find that son-preferring parents typically engage in sex-selection only when they are at or about to exceed their desired parity. 
        There is significant heterogeneity in sex-manipulating behavior based on maternal education, owing to lower desired parity among the educated and a tendency to take-back their decision to sex-select after unsuccessful attempts. </p>

     <li> Groupness among Synthetic Groups: Identity and Interpersonal Behavior </li>
     <button type="button" class="collapsible"> » Abstract </button>
     <div class="content">
     <p style="font-size:90%"> Synthetic groups created in the lab based on trivial and meaningless criteria also favor their "in-group" relative to the "out-group" (<i>groupness</i>). 
          This paper investigates the psychological motive for this behavior. If it were that subjects begin to <i>identify</i> with their assigned group during the experiment, then receiving a poor evaluation from the in-group (acceptance threat to identity) should weaken such identification and decrease groupness. 
          By asking groups to nominate two (out of four) of their members for a bonus, and experimentally manipulating the timing of the nomination status reveal, I find groupness to respond to nominations. 
          Subjects informed of their nomination increase their allocations to the in-group and decrease allocations to the out-group. 
          Those informed of their non-nomination decrease allocations to all and do not maintain any positive distinctness between their in-group and out-group, as if they have <i>disidentified </i>. 
          To rule out <i> expectation of generalized reciprocity </i> as an alternate explanation for the apparent groupness, I find subjects' allocations to the in-group to be comparable under settings where the subjects' respective in-groups can and cannot affect their payoff. 
          There is, however, significant heterogeneity in in-group favor as measured through the size of allocations made in modified dictator games. </p>
