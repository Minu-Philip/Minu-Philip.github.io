I am a 4th year Doctoral Student in the Department of Economics at New York University. My research fields include *Applied Microeconomics* and *Development*. My interests are in studying health, educational, demographic and social outcomes based on social identities (such as gender, religion, caste, etc.) and the role that social norms, institutions and political economy play, in determining these outcomes.
