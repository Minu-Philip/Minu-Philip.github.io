I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford (<a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/young-scholars-program">SIEPR Young Scholar</a>). My research interests are in applied microeconomics, focusing on health and development, with a growing emphasis on integrating machine learning methods to refine analytical approaches and deepen insights. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from New York University in May 2025. I will be joining the Department of Economics at Penn State University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2026.
