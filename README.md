# Minu Philip

I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Doctoral Student in the Department of Economics at New York University. 

My research fields include *Applied Microeconomics* and *Development Economics*. Specifically, my interests are in studying health, educational, demographic and socio-economic outcomes of individuals based on their social identities &mdash; such as gender, religion, caste, etc. &mdash; and the role played by norms, institutions and political economy in determining these outcomes.
