I am a Doctoral Student in the Department of Economics at New York University. 

My research fields include *Applied Microeconomics*, *Development Economics* and *Behavioral Economics*. Specifically, my interests are in studying socio-economic outcomes of individuals based on their social identities &mdash; such as gender, religion, caste, etc. &mdash;  and the role played by norms, institutions and political economy in determining these.
