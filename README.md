I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on health and development.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (<a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/young-scholars-program"> SIEPR Young Scholar </a>), and will be joining the Department of Economics at Penn State University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2026. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from New York University in May 2025.
