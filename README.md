I am a 4th year Doctoral Student in the Department of Economics at New York University. My research fields include *Applied Microeconomics* and *Development Economics*. Specifically, my interests are in studying health, educational, demographic and social outcomes of individuals based on their social identities &mdash; such as gender, religion, caste, etc. &mdash; and the role played by social norms, institutions and the political economy, in determining these outcomes.
