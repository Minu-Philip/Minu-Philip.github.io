I am a Doctoral Student in the Department of Economics at New York University. 

My research fields include *Applied Microeconomics*, *Development Economics* and *Behavioral Economics*. Broadly, my interests are in studying health and socio-economic choices or outcomes of individuals, and the effect of norms, identities, political economy or psychology in determining these.
